## **About myself:**
### I started my career when I studied at the Chinese University of Economics. I opened an English school for children together with Chinese friend. I already worked as a teacher, and after graduation I returned to Russia, worked as an economist.
### But that's not my way. I have a technical mindset. I want to create, invent something new, so now I'm studying programming. And I am ready to spend all my time on programming.
